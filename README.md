#### Intoduction

*Lost and Found is an application that will have IT Delâ€™s students to inform about their lost belongings. It also help to inform the students wether their belongings has been found or not.*

The negligence of students in maintaining the goods resulted in the emergence of unrest among fellow students. Students often don't remember or make mistakes in putting things down. Not only that, it is not uncommon to find incidents of students taking things that do not belong to them. Or the incident when students mistook and took things they thought were theirs. 

Many similar cases occur and are felt on the Del Institute of Technology campus environment. With this problem, the Lost and Found website application was formed to make it easier for students to search for lost items, and submit found items, without having to report directly to the Department of Order and Discipline in matters of finding items.

#### The purpose of Lost and Found:
- Make it easier for students to find lost items,
- Get information on lost items more quickly,
- Make students care more about their belongings,
- Make students have a high sense of honesty in the ownership rights of other people's goods.
